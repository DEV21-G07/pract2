# practica2

!! This is a new repository as I had to delete the old one (see issue #1 for explanation: https://github.com/DEV21-G07/practica2/issues/1)
(Anyhow, there were no commits or anything in the old one so nothing is really lost)

Link to project (as github didnÂ´t work): 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/159zH-t63HN4xmSJBOt80BzSgH6qOlySz/view?usp=drivesdk

Documentation is found in the Wiki.

Commit history (posted in issue #1)
> Here I leave the commit history from my local repository as I was never able to push after adding the Sci-fi package and git LFS.
